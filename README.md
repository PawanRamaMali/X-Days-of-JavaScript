### Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code

Both are free, open source, and available for all operating system.

Take a moment to install these before continuing on with the class.

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser


## Backend Development in Node JS 


## What is Web Server ? 

* Web server is a program that stores, processes, and distributes web pages to the end-user(client-side).

* When a browser(a website) needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP(the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). When the request reaches the correct web server, the server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, through HTTP.

* (If the file does not exist in the server, it returns a 404 response.) 

* The browser makes a GET request through HTTP and the server processes that GET request and send the response accordingly.

 ### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Install Node.js

 ### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Create a project folder

Create a project folder for this tutorial. I'm naming it "building server" and creating a server.js file in it.

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Initialize NPM (Node Package Manager)
 
```
npm init
```

Then it will ask you several questions like the package name, version, description, keywords, and other things. 
You can leave them all default by pressing enter after every step. 
You can give a description and the author's name if you want.
In the end, it'll ask you "Is this OK?" press "y" and then enter.
This will create a package.json file in your project folder. 
This JSON file will keep track of all the packages that you'll install in this project.

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Install Express

Express is a Node.js web application framework that makes making web applications easier. 
To install express, open the terminal inside your project folder and write

### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£: Creating our server

 Open the server.js file in the code editor.

 ```
 const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
     response.send('<h1>Heyüëã</h1>');
})
app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running at port ${port}`);
})
 ```

In the first line of the code we are requiring the express module in our program. 
We do this whenever we use any package.
As mentioned at the beginning of the article when we open a website our browser makes a GET request to the website's server and then the server sends a response back and that response is displayed in our browsers.
In line number 4 of the code we are responding to the GET request made by the browser. 
Using response.send we send back the response we want.
Inside app.get() the first parameter we pass is the route address. 
This is the address where the GET request is made and where our response will be loaded.
The second parameter is a callback function with two parameters: request and response.
And at the end, we are stating where the server is running.

### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£: Compile and run your code

Compile and run server.js using node. Open terminal and type node server.js

Now when you'll open localhost:3000 in your browser you'll see the response you passed in your server.js.



## Callback 

Callback is an asynchronous equivalent of a function. It is a callback function which is called at the completion of the given task. 

Node makes heavy use of callbacks. 


####  Example 

For example, a function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as a parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process a high number of requests without waiting for any function to return results.


The first example shows that the program blocks until it reads the file and then only it proceeds to end the program.

The second example shows that the program does not wait for file reading and proceeds to print "Program Ended" and at the same time, the program without blocking continues reading the file.

Thus, a blocking program executes very much in sequence. From the programming point of view, it is easier to implement the logic but non-blocking programs do not execute in sequence. In case a program needs to use any data to be processed, it should be kept within the same block to make it sequential execution.

### Event Driven Programming

Node.js is a single threaded application. But it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callback. Every API of Node.js is asynchronous and being single threaded, they use async function calls to maintain the concurrency. 

Node used observer pattern. Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event listern function to execute.
