## What is Web Server ? 

* Web server is a program that stores, processes, and distributes web pages to the end-user(client-side).

* When a browser(a website) needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP(the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). When the request reaches the correct web server, the server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, through HTTP.

* (If the file does not exist in the server, it returns a 404 response.) 

* The browser makes a GET request through HTTP and the server processes that GET request and send the response accordingly.
